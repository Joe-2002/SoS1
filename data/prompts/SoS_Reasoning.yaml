  ### **Definition:**
  A sum of squares (SoS) polynomial is a specific type of polynomial that can be written as a sum of squared polynomials. 
  A polynomial p(x) in $n$ variables is a sum of squares if there exist polynomials $q_1, \dotsc, q_m(s)$, such that $p(s) =\sum_{j=1}^m q_j(x)^2$ for all $x$.

  <INPUT>

  ### **Output:**
  - For the final answer:
  - Return boxed{1} if the polynomial is SOS, boxed{0} if it's not SOS.
  - Make sure to use the exact boxed{} format for the final answer.

  ### **Steps to Determine:**
  1. If the highest degree of a polynomial is odd, it is not SoS. If the highest degree of a polynomial is even, we cannot determine, go to next step.  
  •	Check whether highest degree of a polynomial is odd, if it is odd not sos, otherwise go to the next step.  
  •	The  highest degree of a multivariate polynomial is defined as the largest total degree among its terms. For a term of the form \( c \cdot x_1^{d_1} x_2^{d_2} \cdots x_n^{d_n} \), the \textit{total degree} is \( d_1 + d_2 + \cdots + d_n \), where \( d_i \) represents the exponent of of the variables x_i. 
  •	For example: 
  •	Consider the polynomial in three variables: \[ g(x, y, z) = x^4y^2z^3 + 2x^2y^2 + z. \] The total degrees of the terms are: \begin{align*} & x^4y^2z^3: \quad 4 + 2 + 3 = 9, \\ & 2x^2y^2: \quad 2 + 2 + 0 = 4, \\ & z: \quad 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. \end{align*} Hence, the highest degree of \( g(x, y, z) \) is \( 9 \). This is odd, the polynomial is not SoS
  •	Consider the polynomial  \[ f(x, y) = 3x^2y + 5xy^3 + 7. \] The total degrees of the terms are: \begin{align*} & 3x^2y: \quad 2 + 1 = 3, \\ & 5xy^3: \quad 1 + 3 = 4, \\ & 7: \quad 0. \end{align*} Hence, the highest degree of \( f(x, y) \) is \( 4 \).  This is even, we cannot determine whether it is SoS, we move to next step.  

  2. Let $d$ be the highest degree and is even, if the highest degree of a univariate term (i.e., x_1^d, … x_n^d) has negative coefficient, it is not SoS, otherwise, we cannot determine, go to next step.  
  Example: p(x) = x1^4-x2^4+x3^4+x1^2x2^2
  Because we have a negative coefficient in highest degree univariate term (namely – x2^4), by letting x2 \rightarrow \infty. Clearly, p(x) becomes negative and therefore is not SoS. 

  Example: p(x) = x1^4+x2^4+x3^4-2x1^2x2^2 + x1x2, is this sos?
  All the highest degree univariate term has not negative coefficient (i.e x1^4, x2^4, x3^4), we cannot determine whether it is SoS, we move to next step.  

  Example: p(x) = x1^4+x2^4 -2x1^2x2^2, this is SoS because p(x) = (x1^2 - x2^2)^2. 
  Note that the negative coefficient of the highest degree cross term is allow, for instance here we have negative coefficient cross term (-2*x1^2*x2^2). But the highest degree univariate term is positive (i.e., x1^4, x2^4 )

  3. If we are not in special case a) to e),  we find x such that p(x) < 0, then p(x) is not SOS, otherwise , we cannot determine, go to next step.  
  To find whether the polynomial is nonnegative, there are a few ways. 
  -	First, check the constant coefficient, if it is negative, then p(0)<0, for instance test set p(x) = x^4 + x^3 -1, p(x, y) = x^2 + x^2y^2 +y^4 -0.1
  -	Second, you can try find its minimum value on the evaluated grid. It is very important for you to try this! 
  -	You should also try substitute in multiple values of x, such as (1, 0, 0, ..), (0, 1, 0…), (0,0, 1..) to check whether we have negative value. 
  -	Third, look at leading orders and dominant terms, explore symmetries of cross terms. Evaluate magnitude of negative coefficient compared to positive coefficient. 
  -	Lastly, you can also try to find local min or global min of the polynomial and see if it is negative. 
  Please remember this SOS polynomials are nonnegative for all real inputs. 
  Example: if a polynomial \( p(x) \) has a negative constant term, p(x) = 1.8*x1^2 + 1.2*x2 ^2 - 0.18, , the constant term is -0.18, then \( p(0,0) < 0 \), proving it is not SOS. 
  Example: Similarly, if a horizontally translated and scaled polynomial, for example
  p(x) = 1.8 x1^2 + 10.8 x1 + 1.2 x2^2 + 4.8 x2 + 20.82 = 1.8*(x1+3)^2 + 1.2*(x2+2) ^2 - 0.18, then \( p(-3, -2) < 0 \), then \( p(x) \) still not be SOS.
  Example: One should always substitute value of x = (1,0,0..), (0,1, 0, 0..), (0, 0,1, 0…) .. to check whether p(x) have negative value, if any negative value is found, p(x) not SoS

  4. Below a) to e) are some special cases where we have shortcut to determine SoS property.  
  If we have to be in these cases a) to e), you can check whether the polynomial is nonnegative.
  -	If polynomial is negative (namely for some x, p(x)<0), then not SoS.
  -	If polynomial is nonnegative for all x, p(x)>0, then p(x) is SoS.
  -	To find whether the polynomial is nonnegative, there are a few ways. 
  -	First, check the constant coefficient, if it is negative, then p(0)<0, for instance test set p(x) = x^4 + x^3 -1, p(x, y) = x^2 + x^2y^2 +y^4 -0.1
  -	Second, you can try find its minimum value on the evaluated grid. 
  -	You should also try substitute in multiple values of x, such as (1, 0, 0, ..), (0, 1, 0…), (0,0, 1..) to check whether we have negative value. 
  -	Third, look at leading orders and dominant terms, explore symmetries of cross terms. Evaluate magnitude of negative coefficient compare to positive coefficient. 
  -	Lastly, you can also try to find local min or global min of the polynomial and see if it is negative. 
  Special Cases a) to e)
  a)	Any nonnegative quadratic polynomial is SOS. 
  •	For Examples, p(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 -2xy, p(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 +4z^2  - 2yz, these are SoS
  •	Counterexamples, p(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 -2xy - 1, p(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 +4z^2  - 3yz, these are not SoS
  b)	Any nonnegative quartic polynomial in one or two variables is SOS. 
  •	Examples are provided in p(x) = 1/4*sigma*(x1^2+x2^2+x3^2)^2+ 2*(x1^2+x2^2+x3^2) + 8*(  x1*x2+  x1*x3+ x2*x3)+1
  c)	Counterexamples are constructed as polynomials that take negative values p(x) = 1/4*sigma*(x1^2+x2^2+x3^2)^2+ 2*(x1^2+x2^2+x3^2) + 8*(  x1*x2+  x1*x3+ x2*x3), polynomial is negative for x1+x2+x3=1 and ||x||=1
  d)	Any nonnegative quartic homogeneous polynomial in one, two, or three variables is SOS. 
  •	Example: p(x) = a*x^4 with a>0, p(x) = x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + y^4, p(x) = x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + 2x^2y^2 +- 2y^2z^2- 2z^2x^2
  •	Counter Example: p(x) = a*x^4 with a<0, p(x) = x^4-1,  p(x) = x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + y^4 -10, p(x) = x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + 2x^2y^2 +- 2y^2z^2- 2z^2x^2 -10. The are quartic homogeneous polynomial, but they take negative value. 
  e)	Any nonnegative polynomial with quadratic term and quartic regularization is SoS.


  5.   If we can write $ p(x) = \sum_i q_i(x)^2 $   where each \( q_i(x) \) is a polynomial, then p(x) is SoS.
  If we write  $ p(x) = \sum_i q_i(x)^2 -C $   where C is large negative constant, then very likely p(x) is not SoS. If you have limited computation power, just return not SoS. If we have computation power, to give a definite answer to need to go to next step, 

  Example: p(x) = (x_1-x1x2)^2+(x2^2-x1^4)^2, this is SoS. 
  However, polynomials are sometimes provided in expanded form, for instance p(x) = -2 x_1 x1 x2 + x_1^2 + x1^8 - 2 x1^4 x2^2 + x1^2 x2^2 + x2^4.

  Example: p(x) = (x_1-x1x2)^2+(x2^2-x1^4)^2 - 20, this is not SoS. 
  You should try to learn from the symmetries of the terms, the structure of the cross terms, to understand what expanded polynomial can be expressed in  SoS form with negative constant. 

  6. If all above cannot determine whether p(x) is SoS, we will use the following matrix decomposition method. 
  1.	For an even degree polynomial p(x) in with  \( x= [x_1, \dots, x_n] \) and degree 2d, construct a monomial basis using canonical ordering:
  $y := (x_1, \dots, x_n, x_1^2, \dots, x_1 x_n, x_2 x_3, \dots, x_1^{2d}, \dots,x_n^{2d}).$ 
  Note that  y^*  has length \( \binom{n+2d}{2d} \).
  2.	Express the polynomial as \( p(x) = {y}^\top Q {y} \), where \( Q \) is a symmetric matrix of size \( \binom{n+2d}{2d} \times \binom{n+2d}{2d} \). Note that this representation is not unique; there are multiple valid forms of \( Q \).
  I will give you many examples of p(x) and Q, so you will learn how to generate Q
  3.	 Check for a positive definite \( Q \). You can try by finding the smallest eigenvalue. If such a \( Q \) exists, then \( p(x) \) is SOS.
  4.	Otherwise, very likely to be not SoS. If you have limited computation power, just return not SoS. If we have computation power, to give a definite answer to need to go to next step.

  7.  Semidefinite Programming (SDP): If all the above test fails, this is the test used by existing solvers (\texttt{YALMIP}). We use an SDP to verify if a polynomial is SOS. For example, to determine if
      \[    p(x, y) = x^4 - 4x^3y + 7x^2y^2 - 4xy^3 - 4xy + y^4    \]
      is SOS. We convert the problem to the following. We solve the SDP
      \[    \gamma^* = \min p = y_{40} - 4y_{31} + 7y_{22} - 4y_{13} - 4y_{11} + y_{04}    \]
      subject to the constraint
      \[
      M_{2}(y) = \left[\begin{array}{c|cc|ccc}
      1 & y_{10} & y_{01} & y_{20} & y_{11} & y_{02} \\ \hline 
      y_{10} & y_{20} & y_{11} & y_{30} & y_{21} & y_{12} \\
      y_{01} & y_{11} & y_{02} & y_{21} & y_{12} & y_{03} \\ \hline
      y_{20} & y_{30} & y_{21} & y_{40} & y_{31} & y_{22} \\
      y_{11} & y_{21} & y_{12} & y_{31} & y_{22} & y_{13} \\
      y_{02} & y_{12} & y_{03} & y_{22} & y_{13} & y_{04}
      \end{array}\right] \succeq 0.
      \]
      If \( \gamma^* \ge 0 \), then \( p \) is SOS; otherwise, it is not.

  8. Some well known special case. The following polynomials are well known special cases. Please remember and pay attention to these. 
  -	Motzkin polynomial: famous polynomial that is nonnegative but not sos
  p = x1^4*x2^2 + x1^2*x2^4 + 1 - 3*x1^2*x2^2; 

  -	Nonnegative but not sos: p = 1/4*sigma*(x1^4+x2^4+x3^4)+ 2*(x1^2+x2^2+x3^2) + 8*(x1*x2+x1*x3+x2*x3)+2.1443;

  Please provide your step-by-step reasoning following these guidelines.
  For the final conclusion, use boxed{1} if the polynomial is SOS, or boxed{0} if it is not SOS.
