prompt: |
  Please analyze if this polynomial can be expressed as a Sum of Squares (SOS):
  <INPUT>

  Consider these aspects in your analysis:

  1. Examine if the highest degree is odd or even
  2. For even highest degree d, examine the coefficients of highest-degree terms
  3. Consider these special properties:
     - Properties of quadratic polynomials
     - Properties of quartic polynomials in 1-2 variables
     - Properties of quartic homogeneous polynomials in 1-3 variables
     - Properties of even-degree univariate polynomials
  4. Check for any negative values
  5. Try direct sum of squares representation
  6. Consider matrix methods if needed


  For the conclusion, use boxed{1} if it is SOS, or boxed{0} if it is not SOS.
